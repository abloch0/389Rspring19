### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

This is a tough situation. There are multiple ethical concerns to consider. Telling my boss would be the simplest answer, but that runs the risk of the boss firing me. If I knew that my boss would understand the gravity of this situation, then I would just go ahead and tell him. Not every boss would be reasonable though, and in that case I would first tell a consumer watchdog. This would presumably give me a layer of abstraction from which the company can find out about the issue without directly implicating me in the whistleblowing. If that does not work, then I would notify the public. This is the riskiest option since it would implicate me in the whistleblowing, but it would get the word out.
I think that it is important for me to go far and make sure that this issue gets fixed. Since the ECU is vital to the car’s safe operation, it is important to ensure its safety. If the company is unwilling to postpone the release, then I think that the public should be notified in some way or another. That is the only way to make sure people are informed about the cars dangerous ECUs. 
If I do not do anything, then I think I would be partially responsible for the danger. I did not cause (or at least I hope not) these issues, so it is not entirely my fault. But since I am the only one who knows about this then the imperative is on me to help fix it.
